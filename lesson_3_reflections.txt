Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

we know of a change in remote, so would like to manually pull it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: Will make a remote repository copy of another repository remotely. Can push and fetch updates from/to remote local machines

Clone: Can move between reomte and local machines. No push/fetch after that.

branch: Make a copy from the main branch in a repository in a machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We can merge our changes easily and push it back to remote.
